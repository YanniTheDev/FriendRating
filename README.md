# Friend Score Calculation

## What is Friend Score?

Friend Score (FS) is how much you are of a friend to me. The value of FS is clamped between values of
0 to 10, with 0 meaning "**not a friend**" and 10 meaning "**best friend**".

If you wish to find out your **unrestricted / unclamped** (meaning your FS goes beyond 10) FS, please contact me.

## How do I calculate it?

The FS is related to three significant attributes and one insignificant attribute:

### Significant Attributes

- $$T$$ (how often I think about you)
- $$S$$ (how often I see you)
- $$I$$ (how often I interact with you)

Each of these three attributes will score from 0 to 5.

The score you get on each of the attributes is determined on the day before FS is calculated.

If you wish to know what you scored on each attribute, please contact me.

### Insignificant Attributes

- $$F$$ (total number of friends that I am calculating for a FS during this session)

Note that $$F$$ is usually set to a constant and not physically changeable unless I do so.

Altogether, they will combine to form the equation:

$$FS = 10 * \left(\frac{8T + 4S + I^{2}}{85} \right)^{\frac{4\sqrt{S + 5}}{F}}$$

## How do I maximise my FS?

By looking at the equation, you can see that $$I$$ is being raised to the power of two.

This means that increasing $$I$$ (how often I interact with you) increases your overall FS much faster than other attributes.

## When Will I calculate the FS for you?

I calculate the FS for each and everyone that takes part in the Final Positive Thursday in each year!

**NOTE**: The FS you receive will be the FS that was calculated from the most recent Final Positive Thursday.

# Friend Rank Calculation

## What is Friend Rank?

Friend Rank (FR) is how much your individual FS fills up the TOTAL FS that I calculated from a session.

## I'm confused... an example?

Let's say that in a group of three friends (Jimmy, Max, Khan), they have the FS:

- Jimmy: 6.79
- Max: 7.23
- Khan: 4.12

Then the TOTAL FS for this session is: $$ 6.79 + 7.23 + 4.12 = 18.14 $$
